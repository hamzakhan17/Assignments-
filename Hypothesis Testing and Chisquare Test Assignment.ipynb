    "   - The test statistic (t) is calculated using: = Sample Mean−Theoretical Mean/ Standard Error\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Determine the Critical Value*:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - The critical value for a one-tailed test at α = 0.05 is obtained using the ppf function from scipy.stats.norm, which provides the quantile function (inverse of the cumulative distribution function).\n",

    "   - Critical Value: 1.645 (positive because it is for the upper tail).\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Comparison:\n",
    "Since -38 (test statistic) is less than 1.645 (critical value), it falls in the non-rejection region for the null hypothesis in this one-tailed test. Thus, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
